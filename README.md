# Signed Distance Functions in the Unreal Editor
A library providing Signed Distance Functions you can use with your custom raymarcher in Unreal Engine's Material Editor's Custom Nodes. 

## How to use:
To use with Unreal Engine, place this file in [UE_4.24]\Engine\Shaders\Private\, then #include it in Common.ush (Common.ush is located in that same folder).

First time you do this you'll trigger Unreal shader recompilation (it'll take a little while to start up the editor).
You can then use any function described here in your Material Editor's Custom Nodes.

You will probably need to write your own ray marcher for that. This blog post is a good starting point for that: https://sainarayan.me/2017/12/16/raymarching-using-signed-distance-fields-in-ue4/
It also features a plethora of links if you want to delve deeper in the subject.

Here's a quick demo of this library at work: https://www.instagram.com/tv/B_tRy7BhgJT/
